        The students and the faculty of the department have been appreciating the need of constituting the student
        welfare association in order to facilitate the developing qualities among students. To fulfill this need the
        students laid the foundation of their very own society Quaidian Mathematical Society (QMS). It was founded by
        the graduate students in year 2009. This is a non-political society, has no political affiliations with any
        political party or organizations.

        The organization can assure the benefit of students by organizing different co-curricular and extra-curricular
        activities and competitions.
